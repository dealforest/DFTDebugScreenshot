Simple debug tool for screenshot.

It will write out the debug image of the ViewController being displayed.

![demo](https://github.com/dealforest/DFTDebugScreenShot/raw/master/images/demo.gif)

## Requirements
* iOS 7.0 or later
* only ARC

## Usage

1) In your Podfile:

```
pod 'DFTDebugScreenShot'
```

2) In your .m files:

```
#import <DFTDebugScreenshot/DFTDebugScreenshot.h>
```

3) write to the code(`- [UIViewController dft_debugObjectForDebugScreenshot]`) for the debug information.

```objective-c
@implementation DFTViewController
... 
- (id)dft_debugObjectForDebugScreenshot {
    return [[NSUserDefaults standardUserDefaults] dictionaryRepresentation];
}
...
@end
```

### Using auto capture
When you take a screenshot, and automatically write out the debug image.

```objective-c
- (BOOL)application:(UIApplication *)application didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:(NSDictionary *)launchOptions {
  ...
  [DFTDebugScreenshot setTracking:YES];
  ...
}
```

### Without auto capture
It will write out the debug image at the timing at which you intended.

```objective-c
- (IBAction)touchedCaptureButton {
  [DFNDebugScreenshot capture];
}
```

## Without CocoaPods 

If you donâ€™t want to use CocoaPods you can use[CocoaPods Packager](https://github.com/CocoaPods/cocoapods-packager) to generate a static version of DFTDebugScreenshot and just embed that.

## Demo

```shell
$ pod install
$ open DFTDebugScreenshotDemo.xcworkspace
```
